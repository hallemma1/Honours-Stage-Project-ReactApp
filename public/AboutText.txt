This project is to raise awareness about threats penguins are facing in the world. Penguins face many threats in their natural habitats
such as pollution, climate change, and overfishing of species they rely on for a stable food supply. Pollution is a threat 
we can collectively help reduce. Plastic waste in the oceans are often mistaken as food and can lead to internal injuries 
that could be fatal. 
If everyone contributed to recycling thier waste, tonnes of rubbish will avoid landfill and stay out of marine animals homes.
Lets all play out part in helping penguins thrive so all penguins can live happy lives like those at The Deep!
